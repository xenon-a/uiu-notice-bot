UIU Notice Bot
</h1>
<hr/><hr/>


I was inspired to make this discord bot after watching people asking for a discord version of [this](https://github.com/RefatHex/UIU_NOTICE_BOT) telegram bot that [Refat](https://github.com/RefatHex) brother has made.



<b>[Click-here](https://discord.gg/GvuPg8tgBX)</b> to join the discord server of this bot and get latest updates.

<b>Usage:</b> <br/>

    This bot automatically checks for a new notice in the UIU official website every 10 minutes and sends a notification in the server.

    Also, the '/notices' command can be used in the bot's DM or in the server to get the latest notice manually.
